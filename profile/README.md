## Preliminary Questions

### Using Kotlin over Java?

There aren't many differences between the languages other than Kotlin being more functional and less verbose, and those are big reasons why I chose Kotlin. From experience I was writing 25-35% less lines of code in Kotlin than in Java for the same feature due to writing less words. With the knowledge of Design Patterns, OOP paradigms & SOLID principles being transferable, it makes Kotlin a great language to use for faster development. IntelliJ also offers a way to convert Kotlin code to Java code and vice versa, which makes it very versatile to use in current Java projects.
