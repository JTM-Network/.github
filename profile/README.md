# Introduction

A series of personal projects/products using the brand name JTM-Network. The aim of these projects is to solve business problems, using microservice architecture, to split the problems into sub-problems and to be integrated into the Kubernetes Cluster without affecting current processes & offers scalability. Most services used in the Network are public as to show how we solve these problems.

## Preliminary Questions

### Why do you use Kotlin for most of your microservices instead of Java?

There aren't many differences between the languages other than Kotlin being more functional and less verbose, and those are big reasons in why I choose Kotlin. From experience I was writing 25-35% less lines of code for the same feature due to writing less words, and the logic are transferable OOP paradigms are transferable between languages, which make it a great language to use for speedy development. IntelliJ also offers a way to convert Kotlin code to Java code and vice versa, which makes it very versatile to use. Consider Kotlin as the Python language for the JVM.
